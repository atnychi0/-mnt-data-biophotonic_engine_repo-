Achieving Near-Zero Emissions Through Light-Based Combustion Mimicry

License: MIT (with Crown License required for propulsion system manufacturing)

## Abstract
This paper introduces a revolutionary fuel injection system that replaces traditional spark ignition with high-intensity, tunable biophotonic lasers. These trigger a controlled dissociation of fuel molecules, resulting in clean, efficient combustion with near-zero emissions. Unlike explosions, this is a light-triggered fuel decomposition process — “combustion without fire.”

## Core Benefits
- Ultra-low emissions (NOx, CO)
- High combustion efficiency through full molecular dissociation
- Reduced engine heat, noise, and vibration
- Modular design adaptable to retrofits or new platforms

## Deployment
This document is public for academic and prototyping discussion. A Crown Sovereign License is required for commercial or military vehicle integration.

1. Abstract
-----------
For over a century, internal combustion has relied on chaotic spark-based ignition. This paper presents an alternative:
Biophotonic Fuel Injection Engines. These use synchronized high-intensity lasers to dissociate fuel molecules with light.

2. Problem: The Inefficiency of the Spark
-----------------------------------------
- Incomplete combustion = unburnt hydrocarbons
- Extreme heat = NOx and CO production
- Wasted energy = loud, inefficient, dirty

3. Solution: Combustion Without Fire
------------------------------------
- Lasers dissociate molecules without explosion
- Uniform energy distribution
- Clean, silent, and mechanically efficient

4. License & Status
-------------------
- MIT for public use and research
- Crown License required for engine-scale applications
